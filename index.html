				<h2>A Little About Liam</h2>
				<h2>August 20th, 2014</h2>
				<p>This was the day you changed our lives forever! That evening, you entered this world. I remember how I felt during the drive to St Michael's Hospital to come see you for the first time: <span class="gold">pure excitement and happiness</span>. When I walked into the hospital room, my heart instantly melted. There you were - all 7 lbs of you - wrapped in a blanket like a burrito, and wearing that little blue toque.</p>

				<h2>Does Liam Love EDM?!</h2>
				<p>When you were 17 months old, I heard you sing for the first time, and this was when I knew you'd love EDM! This was an awesome discovery because this is my favourite type of music, and this moment was the beginning of our shared musical connection. It was Moving Day, and you were about to move right across the street from your Dida, Dada and I. This was a really exciting day! On the morning of the move, I played <span class="yellow">"Roses" by The Chainsmokers</span> and you sang along to the chorus. I couldn't get over how cute this moment was, and it still brings a smile to my face every time I think about it.</p>

				<p>These are a few of the adorable things you would say when you wanted me to turn on the music and go into Dance Machine mode. You would start hopping on the bed from the moment you learned how to walk and could keep going, and going, and going....and going haha. Such an Energizer Bunny, and I love how you would also love my favourite songs, especially those by Above & Beyond! </p>

				<h2>Remember When You Were Obsessed With Monsters?!</h2>
				<p><span class="yellow">"RAWR!!!"</span></p>
				<p><span class="yellow">"I wanna play monster game please!"</span></p>
				<p>Yup, there was a point when you were 3 years old that you'd walk around and imitate a monster! You would always ask me to watch you do it, and you'd run away as soon as I started acting like a monster too. We would chase each other around the apartment until I was out of breath!</p>
				<p>My favourite "Monster Memories" with you was when I used to play the Playstation 4 game "Shadow of the Colossus" (by the time you can read this, there will probably be a Playstation 7 or 8!). It was a game where I'd go around hunting for these large monsters that you absolutely couldn't get enough of watching. You'd sit beside me for hours and watch me play, and you were my little video game companion. It was the last game I played before you flew away to Edmonton, and I burst into tears when I came home from the airport after dropping you off and seeing the game sitting on the TV stand. That video game is now my favourite game because of all those priceless memories we had together. Check out the gameplay :)</p>

				<p>Below are some adorable photos of you as a baby and toddler. Look at how photogenic you were! You loved taking control of the camera, and snatched it out of my hands whenever possible. Take a look at this selfie video you made as proof, too.</p>

				<h2>Letter from Chachu (Uncle)</h2>
				<p>
					I want to keep this as short and sweet as possible, Liam, as I don’t want to bore you and I know you’ve got to get back to playing your <span class="virtual">Virtual Reality</span> video games, or whatever it is that kids do for fun in the 2020s.
				</p>
				<p>					
					When you were born back in August of 2014, it was <span class="yellow">one of the happiest moments of my life.</span> I was almost done university and living in Guelph at the time, while you were home in Toronto. I wanted to come home as often as possible to come see you, because I thought you were <span class="adorable">the most adorable baby I had ever seen…</span>And I’m not just saying that because I’m your Chachu – you were a hit with the ladies too! I would look into your eyes and see a reflection of me, except a much cuter version. 
				</p>

				<p>
					When you became old enough to walk on your own two feet, it was very soon afterwards that you started to dance. I feel that this was when our friendship reached new levels, because I loved dancing -- especially to electronic music! When I played my music on my Bluetooth speaker (I wonder if Bluetooth is still a thing when you’re reading this…), you would climb onto my bed without any help, and start furiously hopping on the bed. You would be in perfect sync with the song, and you were honestly a better dancer than 95% of the people I'd see at clubs -- before you even hit your 3rd birthday. I was mesmerized by how you loved the exact same songs as I did, and I would always play my favourite songs for you to see your reaction. You would never disappoint! <span class="superstar">You were kind of a superstar on my Snapchat and Instagram</span> (I wonder if you’ll know what these are), and my friends couldn’t get enough of watching you dance.
				</p>
				<p>
					I could go on forever about how much you mean to me, Liam, and that still wouldn’t be enough. Words can’t describe how much of a positive impact you’ve had on all our lives. During some of the darkest times of my life, you would find ways to make me laugh and bring light into it, and I could never thank you enough for that. I hope I can be the same for you, and just be a friend that’s <span class="always">always there for you, through good times and bad.</span>
				</p> 
				<p>
					At the time of writing this -- in May of 2018 -- you had just moved to Edmonton, and <span class="flew">it felt like a big piece of me flew away with you.</span> But I know by the time you’re reading this, I’ll have flown to see you many times, and you’ll have flown to see me too. And we’ll have stayed good friends, because distance does not matter when you truly love someone. Ask your mom and dad about that 😊 <span class="red">I love you more than words could describe, Liam</span>, and I know you’ll have grown into a bright, smart, and handsome man by the time you’re reading this. Never stop dancing, little man. 😊
